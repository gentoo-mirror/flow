		Haskell XMPP (eXtensible Message Passing Protocol, a.k.a. Jabber) library
		
		Unlike package network-protocol-xmpp, which uses libxml-sax, this library uses HaXml and supports MUC.
		However, MUC support of the moment is worse than that in package XMPP.
		
		This library make extensive use of STM and threads to simplify writing message-handling code.
